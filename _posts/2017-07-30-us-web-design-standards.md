title: U.S. Web Design Standards

In early 2016 I first became aware of the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov). When the inevitable question came up of how/when/if we would incorporate it into our existing Drupal 7 site, among my team there were mutterings of "that's cool, but...", "is it required?", and finally "I think we're good".

Fast forward to 2017 - we're increasingly hearing of possible redesigns coming "down the pike", and also of potential for a brand new site. Everyone on the team begins to groan with the knowing dread of impending design-by-committee nightmares, and the huge expense of hiring contractors to develop responsive and accessible front-ends.

Finally someone (I won't name names, but it starts with B and ends with K and has ROC in the middle) has the bright idea of using the U.S. Web Design Standards, and in one fell swoop averting the design committee AND the front-end contractors. Thus began my involvement with the Web Design Standards.

Since then, I have been doing a lot of work integrating the Standards with Drupal 7 and Drupal 8, as well as championing the use of the Standards within my organization whenever possible. Along those lines I will be writing a series of blog posts about the Standards here. My intention is to cover these topics:

1. What exactly ARE the U.S. Web Design Standards?
1. What does it mean to "use" the U.S. Web Design Standards, and why should we?
1. Drupal and the U.S. Web Design Standards: The theme
1. Drupal and the U.S. Web Design Standards: The modules
1. Jekyll and the U.S. Web Design Standards

The final post about Jekyll will go up at the same time as this site (which by happy coincidence, is built with Jekyll) converts over to using the U.S. Web Design Standards itself.

More soon!
