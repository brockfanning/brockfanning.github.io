I read a great quote today by Jorge Luis Borges:

> The composition of vast books is a laborious and impoverishing extravagance.
> To go on for five hundred pages developing an idea whose perfect oral
> exposition is possible in a few minutes!"

There are a lot of great novels out there, I'm sure, that fully need to be as long as they are. But I suspect there are a larger number that are only that long because that's the norm. How many authors agonize over how to make their story 100 pages longer? How many tedious plot twists and extraneous characters have we endured just because the book wasn't long enough?*

But if too-long novels were the worst offenders, I wouldn't really care. A much more insidious culprit that I see is the TV show. Why does a TV show have to stretch out its narrative over 26 episodes? A silly question of course, because we all know that the main purpose of a TV show is, and has always been, to trick viewers into seeing ads. The more ads, the better. So it's no great mystery.

But why do we still pretend that these TV shows are so "good"? I hear that TV is in a golden age right now, with all of these widely-acclaimed shows like Game of Thrones and the Walking Dead. We all know why the studios want us to watch. We all know they want us to watch more and more. Clearly the TV shows are "good" indeed, because they are getting better and better at holding our attention.

I worry about the direction of story-telling in our world. As media for story-telling get more and more ad-riddled, what happens to their purpose? Maybe it's already happened. Maybe we have already passed the point where the purpose - the ultimate goal and sole aim - of story-telling is no longer to inspire, educate, move, or remind, but instead just to attract and hold our attention for as long as possible, so that we see the maximum number of ads.

* Did that sentence seem too short also? Probably because it only had 2 parts. How many 3-part sentences have we slogged through because 3 things sound better than 2? This makes me feel angry, mad, and irritated...
