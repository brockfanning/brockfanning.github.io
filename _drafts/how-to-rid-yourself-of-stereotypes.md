title: How to rid yourself of stereotypes
---
If we are making any progress at all in righting the wrongs of our white ancestors, it seems to me confined to the realm of law. Even though our progress in this area is horribly inadequate, I think that our progress in the realm of the human mind is even moreso. This is a realm that, unfortunately, is so much harder to control.

So what are some strategies for ridding yourself of these stereotypes that, when extended to the multitudes, perhaps single-handedly keep the black people down.

Talking: When you pass someone on the street, observe their color, their manner of dress, their facial structure, their choice of food, their hair - you have but a moment to consider them. This moment has a beginning and an end, even if the whole thing takes less than a second. If Hollywood movies are any indication, we certainly like neat endings. So your brain, at the end of this split-second consideration of another being, wants desparately to tie a bow around the whole thing, and package it up nice and neat for long-term memory storage.

This is where the stereotypes play their role. We don't actually know anything about this person - but this is not the first time we've seen someone with that hairstyle, that outfit, those tatoos, those headphones. Perhaps it's the fifth, or maybe the fiftieth time - and so the brain dumps the whole interaction into that existing bucket, along with the other 49 times. "Oh, THAT kind of person. I get it. Next?"

How do we break this cycle of stereotyping? One way - perhaps the only way, really - is to prove to yourself that the stereotype is wrong. This is tough, especially with a passing pedestrian on the street, since within moments they are gone, and there is no way you could ever truly know whether your split-second judgement was accurate. Talking to people, then, is the clear solution. Give yourself a reason to doubt the stereotype. The more you see that your stereotyped conclusions are completely wrong, the less you will jump to them.

It's worth talking about talking. The above recommendation is much easier said than done. So what are some strategies to facilitate conversation? In order to strike up a conversation in a natural way, you need to have something in common. This is why small-talk about the weather is so common: it's the one thing that everybody in a locale can safely be assumed to have in common.

So what are some less hackneyed avenues to conversation?

* mentioning whatever is printed on a t-shirt
* asking where some clothing or hairstyle was bought
* bringing up the amount of traffic
