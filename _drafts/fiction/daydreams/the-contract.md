# The arrests

"Riding a train." muttered David without moving his lips.

We three prisoners sat hunched, shackled and sweating in the back of the cart as it bounced along the road to Goodwater. We had all been picked up separately by the two deputies on that same day. David, a young kid of about 14, had just quietly volunteered his crime.

"Loud talking by a white lady." whispered John, another kid in the cart. He was careful to make sure the deputies couldn't hear.

I was not so cautious. "These deputies arrested me for vagrancy." I declared loudly to my fellow prisoners. Then, turning to the front of the cart, "Do I have that right?"

"Shut up, nigger, or I'll kill you." barked Bill, the deputy assigned to guard duties, as he looked up and hefted his rifle. His assitant Arnold faced forward, driving the mule toward our next destination.

"Alright." I answered. David and John kept their eyes downward, watching the road pass between the boards of the cart.

On we bounced. The deputies picked up one more man. They hadn't actually charged him with anything, but their sole question, "Have you got a job, nigger?" implied that they aimed to use the old stand-by crime of vagrancy, like they had with me. The two white men seemed happy, even excited, about their haul of four men. They probably stood to make more money today than in the past two weeks together. The new man was about my age, 25 or so, though not as tall.

# The trials

We finally rolled up outside a general store, and after a few minutes sitting outside, a clerk came out wearing an apron and a long mustache.

"Got four!" said Arnold.

"Ok, let me get the papers ready." said the clerk. And then he added, "He's here." gesturing to an old bearded farmer seated out front on a bench, focused on smoking a pipe and enjoying the shade.

About 30 minutes passed before the clerk emerged again and said a few words to the farmer. The farmer nodded, rose slowly and sauntered over to the cart, limping slightly. He got close to my side - near enough that I could have grabbed him. While I was thinking about that course of action, the farmer gave the clerk a nod, held up four fingers, and the two of them went inside.

"Hot damn!" said Bill happily, as he unshackled David and jerked him off the cart, dragging him into the store. They were inside about 10 minutes, while Arnold kept his own rifle trained on us. I took note of a ring of keys hanging from Arnold's belt. Eventually the deputy brought David back out, and locked him back in the shackles, grabbing John next and heading back inside.

"Made me sign a contract." muttered David. "Think I'm to work off a debt."

I nodded slightly, keeping my eyes on Arnold. Seemed like about 10 or 20 feet across the street to an alley. After a time John came back out, and got shackled back into the cart as well, apparently having been given the same deal as David.

Deputy Bill picked me next, unlocked my shackles and pulled me towards the back of the cart. At that same moment, I shifted my weight in the opposite direction, and Bill's grasped slipped off ineffectually. He eyes flashed and glared. I acted like I hadn't even noticed.

"Oh, you want me to come with you?" I asked dumbly.

The deputy went to hit me with the back of his rifle, but at that moment, I hopped up with a sudden speed and landed on the ground next to him, nearly a full foot taller. Too close to hit me, he faltered backwards and stumbled. I caught him by the shoulder and propped him back up.

"You OK, Deputy Bill?" I asked.

Bill's face showed a look of anger and confusion. He clearly had not been in this situation in recently history, and did not quite know how to react. As his people tended to do, he took a breath and got ready to react with violence. His grip on the rifle tightened.

"I think they're waiting for us, Bill." I interjected, gesturing to the clerk and farmer, watching from the window of the general store. Then, while Bill was caught off guard, in a lower voice I added, "I'm a big man, Bill. All this pushing and grabbing is just going to look silly. I'll just walk ahead of you, OK?"

And without waiting, I headed towards the store. Bill was left with a choice between attacking me from behind, or going along with me. He choose the latter. From the corner of my eye, I saw the fourth prisoner in the cart grin slightly, having overheard the exchange.

I ducked into the general store, and Bill came in after, slamming the door shut. The mustached clerk rearranged some papers. The farmer looked at me with some interest. No doubt he noticed my large frame, and was thinking about how much cotton I could pick in a day.

"I, being Justice of the Peace in these parts," recited the clerk, "find you guilty of riding a train. What's your name?"

I gave my name, after which the clerk starting filling in some blanks on a paper. "Vagrancy, though." I added.

"Shut up, nigger." reacted the clerk, but then followed up with, "What's that now?".

"Bill and Arnold picked me up for vagrancy, not riding a train."

The clerk looked at Bill questioningly. Bill shrugged and muttered something like, "Yeah maybe."

The clerk appeared to consider drafting a new document, but opted to scratch something out on the page and scrawled a few letters, mouthing the word "Vagrancy" as he wrote.

He then tallied up some numbers, and continued. "You are hereby fined 1 dollar, plus court costs, which total 78 dollars. Have you got 79 dollars?"

"No." I said.

"Then you will be sent to the Alabama state prison for 2 years time. I imagine they'll work you in the Pratt mines." Then the clerk turned to the farmer. "Mr. Bailey, you want this nigger?"

The farmer answered slowly, "Yeah I'll pay that, I guess... If he agrees to the terms."

The clerk continued, switching back into legal recitation mode. "If you agree to these terms by marking your X here," he brandished a sheet of paper, "then your court costs will be paid and you will be spared the state prison mines. Do you agree?"

All eyes turned towards me, at that moment. I met each pair of eyes with consideration, taking my time before answering. The clerk's gaze rested squarely on my mouth, clearly interested only in my verbal response. Bill looked on with a deep, uneducated anger. The farmer sized me up like a customer inspecting the struts of a wagon wheel.

I took a step toward the farmer. "You mean, you would do that for me, Mister Bailey? You would pay my debts?"

The farmer's eyes met mine, and his brow raised a bit. "Yeah," he said, "if you agree to the terms in that there contract." He straightened up a bit. "I'm sure you would be a good nigger."

"Well," I said, "I don't know quite what to say. I've never had white folk looking after my interests so well. Well at least, not since I was a slave to old master."

The room was quiet and so I continued.

"I appreciate it greatly, I truly do. What are the terms?"

The clerk jumped back in, "The contract says that you'll work until your debts are paid in full, for Mister Bailey. Right here is where you sign." The clerk held out a pen towards me, placed the contract on the table, and pointed to a blank spot on the paper.

I stepped toward the table, ignored the pen and snatched up the paper before he could stop me.

"What are you doing?" asked the clerk sharply. "Put that down and sign it."

"Oh," I said, "don't you worry about that, Justice, I'll surely sign. But if there's one thing old master taught me, it's to always read a contract before you sign. Old master said you've got to know what you're agreeing to."

I sat down in the nearest chair and started examining the document with focused concentration. My eyes darted around the page haphazardly, and I nodded seriously. The white men, although clearly irritated by my delay, humored me with snickers and sneers, fully convinced that I was pretending to read. (And they were correct. I had never learned.)

But, though I didn't know exactly what was in the contract, I knew the type of people that had written it. I knew what they wanted, I knew what they needed, and I knew the lengths that they were willing to go in order to get it. I knew that values like morality and honor had long ago deserted this region of the world, even though its denizens still pretended to possess them in order to satisfy legal requirements.

"Oh...", I wrinkled my forehead, "Well, there is some stuff missing in these terms."

The room grew still as the white men's assumption of my illiteracy came into question.

"Nah, it's fine and complete. Sign it." said the clerk.

"Not quite," I said. Though I couldn't read, I did know numbers. "I don't see anything on here with the total of the debt. 79 dollars, was it?"

The clerk and the farmer crowded behind me and looked over my shoulder. I made no movement nor gesture of defensiveness, and thought how long it had been since a white man had been so close behind me without a whip in his hand. The white men must have taken notice of my confidence as well.

The clerk muttered a curse, filled in a blank spot on the contact with "79", and then pointedly placed the pen on the table next to my hand. I ignored it and resumed my examination of the contract. Bailey and the clerk stepped back a bit uncomfortably.

"That's it now, you'll sign it?" said the clerk.

"Well," I said, still relying on the lack of numbers on the page. "There is still something missing. It doesn't say what my daily wage is."

"You'll work until the debt is paid. One year, see?" The clerk pointed at a spot on the contract.

"Oh, one year, I see. How many days in a year?" I asked.

"Three hundred sixty five, dumb nigger." said Bill, eager to jump in with a dig.

"Good then," I said, "Justice if you get on your counting machine, and split up 79 dollars in 365 parts, that'll be a day's wage, right? Just mark that it and I'll sign."

The clerk was incensed, and slammed his hand on the table. "Rot in the prison mines, then." and snatched up the contract. "Get this nigger to the jail!" he barked at Bill.

Bill snapped to attention and put his hand roughly on my shoulder. Then, there was a slight hesitation. It may have been Bill considering his inability to manhandle me, but there was more. I saw it in the other white men as well. They were trying to give me a chance to reconsider. They *wanted* me to sign. There was money at stake. Putting me in the state prison was less profitable for them.

"Hold up now," I said, buying myself some time. "State prison mines, you say? What kind of mines?"

"Coal, most likely." spat the clerk.

"Right, coal." I said. And then it hit me. I continued. "So I've got to choose between Mister Bailey's farm, and some coal mines owned by the state of Alabama, right?"

"Pratt mines, yeah." corrected Bailey.

"Oh, Pratt... that outfit, right..." I pretended to understand. "I'm pretty good at mining. Old master use to have me down at the quarry sometimes. Sometimes at the sawmill. Sometimes in the field. I reckon I did all kinds of jobs. Old master used to say I was the best on the plantation."

I gave them a second to consider my words, then went on.

"Guess I'm OK to do farming or mining alike. It's no matter to me. Just a question of best conditions, I reckon." I tried to use their jargon so they could follow along.

I turned to the farmer. "I'm sure you treat your farm hands real good sir, but if I can't have a fair contract then I'll go to the mines."

With that, I pushed the chair back with a quick scratch, and stood up to leave, much to the relief of Bill. I led the two of us to the door of the general store and opened it myself.

"Hold up, nigger." said the farmer. "Ted, just break out that counting machine and put the nigger's wage on there. Ain't no harm in that."

And there it was. I had squeezed, and they had budged. It confirmed it, they needed me. They didn't need to know that I had never worked on a plantation, and didn't know the first things about mining or farming.

I turned around and pushed past Bill, sitting back in the chair. The clerk, aka justice of the peace, aka Ted, was forced to reach over my shoulder to write in an addendum with a daily wage, yet again placing the pen next to my hand. And yet again, I ignored it and continued to examine the contract.

Emboldened by my clear leverage, I began to make more assumptions about the terms. But I had to proceed with caution - any further pushing would likely backfire. I decided to give up some ground.

"If I was you Mister Bailey, I'd want a real clear guarantee of how much work my men would do." I suggested. "Ain't it a good idea to put on here how many hours I gotta work each day? What do you think, 10 hours a day?"

I knew that was low, but I wanted to give them room to haggle. And it worked like a charm. The men got into it amonst themselves. Sneering and chuckling between each other about how much they could work me. By the end, they settled on 14 hours a day.

"Ok then," I said, "put it down there."

The clerk, perhaps without realizing it that he had let a black man direct him, added another addendum to the contract. The farmer looked pleased.

I quickly continued, "Now I guess if I'm sick or take a day off work, I don't make no wages on that day, right?"

"Well, damn straight." said the farmer.

"So if that happens, we gotta add one day to my terms, right?"

The white men were now hopelessly involved in a dialog with a negro - and somehow were actually going along with it. The clerk jumped in. "Yeah, but we take care of that."

"How do you do that?"

"We change this right here." He pointed again to the one-year clause.

"Oh no, Mister Bailey, I don't think that's good for you at all." I said, feigning concern for his farm business. "What if a farm hand gets hold of his contract and changes that hisself. Just one number changes and they whole debt is paid in full. That sounds downright dangerous."

Again the clerk interjected. "Changes to this here contract ain't legal unless they get signed by both sides, boy."

"Well if it was me, Mister Bailey, I'd want that in the contract. To protect my investments, you see? But that's just me..."

The farmer slowly peered over my shoulder and half-heartedly glanced down the contract. "That ain't in there, Ted?"

The clerk shook his head. "I ain't sure but I reckon that's standard--"

"Put it in then dammit! This nigger knows his law better'n you!"

"Oh I don't know no law," I said as the clerk penned a new clause. "I just know good sense when I hear it."
