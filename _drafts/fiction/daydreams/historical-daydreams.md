Thoughts on short fiction series:

Basic idea: Fiction realization of those daydreams we all have, where we wish we could go back in time and stop some injustice or tragedy. Examples of this are Django Unchained, Inglorious Basterds, and Quantum Leap. Key elements are:

* Setup that establishes the hopeless and infuriating nature of the injustice
* Main character always uses intelligence to combat the enemy - never force, never modern technology. Just logic, strategy, understanding of the enemy's perspective, ability to transcend human desires/limitations and make robot-like choices. (Gotta stay human though, for the reader to identify...)
* Bittersweet endings: The main character may be victorious, but the rest of the world still endures the injustice that we all know happened. Make sure it doesn't seem like a Hollywood happy ending.
* In may ways, these are revenge stories.

Plots

Post-emancipation era of convict-leasing and forced labor

Story 1: Arrest and contract

* White southerners can convict black men of anything: vagrancy (not having money). Loud talking near white women. Main character stands up to this, uses some strategy to avoid arrest. This angers the white men who were trying to arrest him. So they try again, and main character somehow turns the tables and has them arrested. They escaped, disgraced and ruined, and lynch the main character.
* White southerners would convict black men of misdemeanour and then charge large court fees, and force black men to sign forced labor contracts to pay off fees. If they didn't sign, they would be leased as convicts. So it was forced labor either way. Main character somehow gets out of this seemingly impossible situation.
    * Can't sign the contract.
    * Can't get put into convict mines.
    * Can't escape simply by proving intelligence.
    * Can't be saved by white men.

    * Asks to read it. The white men resist, but main character uses smooth talk to paint the white men into a corner where they have to let him read it, in order to uphold their "southern honor".
    * Main character feeds the white men's obstensible reason for "offering" the contract: that they wanted to help the black man by keeping him out of prison. That they were loaning him money as a kindness. Props up their egos, makes them actually believe this rationalization, and then uses it to corner them logically.
    * Farmer is present, and sees the fitness of the main character. Wants him as a laborer. Main character sees this and exploits it. Understands the enemy: they don't want to be evil, cruel, in itself. They just want money. Talks about the things he can do - bend metal, fell trees, spit rock. Turns it into a competition between the farmer and the mining corporations. Figures out how to pit them against each other - talks about mining corporations acquiring land, building interstate commerce and ruining the farmers' livelihoods.
    * Agrees to sign it, but warns that the contract is invalid. (Capitalizes on the white men's stupidity.) Constructs a complicated legal explanation of why the contract is invalid and would not hold up in federal court. But, actual aspects of those contracts WERE unconstituational. Not allowing workers to leave. Treatment as a convict. Requires certain addendums to the contract:
        * Total of debt is printed on the contract.
        * Main character can pay off his own debt with any state-supported currency.
        * Total requirements for daily productivity are printed on the contract (gets the white men into a snide discussion/argument about what the main character is capable of producing in a day)
        * Additional productivity is removed from debt total at a specified rate.
        * Price of food and lodging is printed on contract.
        * All decreases to the amount of the debt, apart from the daily allowance, need to be added to the contract as an addendum signed by both parties. (Clearly a hardship to the main character, to which the white men gladly agree to.)
        * All INCREASES to the amount of the debt, apart from the aforementioned food and lodging fees, need to be added to the contract as an addendum, signed by both parties. (Hence the reason for the above - but which the white men are cornered into agreeing to, out of basic fairness and symmetry. They resist but are convinced.)

Unable to escape the impossible situation, main character signs the ammended contract and is shipped off to the farm, for the next episode. (Maybe?)
