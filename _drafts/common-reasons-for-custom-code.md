title: Common reasons for custom code

I love writing custom code for Drupal sites. I am a programmer, after all. It makes things neat. It makes things efficient. And it's fun. But I have to recognize that, all things being equal, it's a best practice to limit custom code to an absolute minimum. If you're going to customize something, you'll want to make sure you have a good reason.

So I'd like to take a look at some of the more common examples of those reasons. Here goes:

## Reasons you will need custom code

1. That module's text box needs to be above that other one

2. Your server has a weird quirk

3. Your users are used to another CMS

4. Those Views exposed filter forms are just not quite right

5. The project has some custom blocks

6. The permission system is complicated

7. The site displays ads

8. You need to integrate with an obscure javascript library

9. The product owners are really picky

10. You need a contrib module to behave differently (not better, just different)

11. Your site needs to talk to another site
